# Intro
## what is langue.me
@iiicp : 100 days -> c compiler
@Mepy : Wow, Nice!
Make a language!

Language name is langue.me
Why? My name is Mepy, half of which is Me. And, me, aka Make a language by me!

@iiicp : cool! <- c compiler

@Mepy : language, langue.me -> cool, apply what I learnt, and work.

## how to make a language
Programme Language: 
- JavaScript(First)
- C/C++(Second)
- OCaml(For Quick Mind Test)

Basic Knowledge: 
1. Lexer
2. Parser(Context-Free-Grammar, CFG)

```c
int main()
{
    char x = 0; // -> "char" "x" "=" "0" ";"
    return y; // -> "return" "y" ";"
}
```

3. Checker
    - Name
    - Type

Source Code -> Abstract Syntax Tree, AST -> Intermediate Representation, IR 

---

4. Execution
    - Compile : Physical Machine \
        x86, arm, risc-v, mips, loongarch, ...
    - Interprete : 
        - Runtime
        - Virtual Machine, VM \
            Java -> Java Virtual Machine, JVM
        

## design langue.me
1. Cool -> Cool Features
2. Works well
3. Meaning

Features:
- Quick Interpreter
- Generate C code \
    langue.me source code -> useful C code \
    cover features of C.

Quick -> Lexer, Parser, run on AST, jump Checker Phase

use JavaScript, C/C++ to write the implementation of langue.me

Parser Combinator -> Lexer, Parser : OK
Checker : By hand

AST, IR -> Intermediate, Core of the implementation of a language

AST -> Convenient, Useful

Next, AST first. AST OK => Checker => Lexer, Parser

langue.me VM : Stack
IR : SSA
